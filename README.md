# CS3240-HoozList
HoozList is a web application that re-envisions UVA's original professor made course index application Lou's List. This application was developed as part of the Advanced Software Development course (CS 3240) at the University of Virginia.

## Features
Our application offers a range of features to help UVA students plan their course schedules:
* Google Authentication: Users can log in using their Google accounts.
* View and Search Classes: Students are able to view and search classes that are separated into logical categories.
* Planner: Students are able to save all prospective classes they're interested in taking. 
* Schedule: Create an actual schedule that accounts for time conflicts between classes. The system prevents time conflicts and prevents signing up for multiple sections of the same course.
* Social Networking: Students are able to "friend" other students to see their schedule and leave a comment on their schedule.

## Tech Stack
The following technologies were used in the development of this application:

* Django Framework
* Heroku
* Python, JS, CSS, HTML
* Bootstrap
* PostgreSQL
* SIS API
* Google Authentication

## Usage
To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Open the web application in a web browser.
2. Browse and search for classes using the search bar or categories.
3. Add classes to your schedule planner to generate a prospective schedule.
4. View your friends' schedules and leave comments on their schedules.
